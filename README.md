# Curses I guess
## Some experementation in curses
It took a while, but I finally have pdcurses up and running.
I don't have a specific end goal with this project.
To start with I will make some simple games to get a feel for the library.

## Libraries
- Windows: [pdcurses](https://pdcurses.org)
- Linux: ncurses
